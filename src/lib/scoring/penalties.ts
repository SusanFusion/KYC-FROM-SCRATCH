 * single one-day absence would. Separate, non-consecutive dates are
 * untouched -- each one is its own run and still deducts on its own, same
 * as before this existed.
 *
 * Mirrors monthlyGraceShare just above: walks the agent's FULL history for
 * this code (same reason as there -- a run can span whichever single
 * date/period happens to be in view right now), groups it into maximal
 * consecutive-day runs, and returns this one entry's *share* of its run's
 * flat deduction -- the earliest entry in each run carries the whole
 * deduction, every other entry in that run carries 0, so the total shown
 * across the log always adds up to exactly one deduction per run (the
 * table already renders a 0-deduction entry as a plain dash, same as a free
 * monthlyGrace occurrence -- see PenaltyRecordsTable).
 *
 * A run only merges entries whose occurredOn dates are back-to-back
 * calendar days (a gap of exactly 1 day, including two entries landing on
 * the very same date) -- any bigger gap (a weekend with no entries logged
 * in between, or any other gap) starts a new run. This treats "consecutive"
 * as literal calendar days; if it's meant to skip scheduled days off, that
 * would need each agent's working-day calendar, which isn't modeled
